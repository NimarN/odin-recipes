            <li>3/4 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>

            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for brushing</li>
            <li>Cornmeal, for dusting</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>For The Toppings</strong>
        </p>
      
        <ul>
            <li>1 28-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling</li>
            <li>Torn fresh basil, for topping</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough: Combine the warm water and yeast in a small bowl, 
                stirring to dissolve the yeast. Combine the flour and salt in a medium bowl.
                 Add the yeast mixture to the flour and stir to make a shaggy dough. (The dough should be tacky. If it feels too wet and sticky, a
                 dd flour, 1 tablespoon at a time; if it's too stiff,add a little water.) Transfer to a lightly oiled surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 3 minutes. Place an inverted bowl over the dough 
                  and let rise slightly, 30 minutes. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and form each into a ball; arrange 3 inches apart on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Rub the tops of the dough lightly with olive oil and 
                  cover the baking sheet with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 hours before baking; let sit, covered, until ready to use. One hour before baking, put a pizza stone or inverted baking sheet on the middle oven rack and preheat to 
                500 degrees F (or 550 degrees F if your oven goes that high)</li>
            <li>Make the sauce: Combine the tomatoes and their juices with 
                1 teaspoon salt in a blender; blend until smooth.</li>
            <li>Generously sprinkle a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet with cornmeal. Place 1 ball of dough upside down on the cornmeal using floured hands. Gently pull the dough into an 8- to 10-inch circle, reflouring your hands as needed and being careful not to deflate the dough. Spread about 1/4 cup tomato sauce on the crust; top with one-quarter of the mozzarella. D
                rizzle with 1 to 2 teaspoons olive oil and season with salt.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizza onto the hot stone and bake until the crust is dark golden brown and the cheese is bubbling, 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with basil. 
                Let cool 2 minutes before slicing. Repeat to make 3 more pizzas.</li>
        </ol>
